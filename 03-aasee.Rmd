# The Aasee Dataset

To learn the basics about data types, data handling and the fundamentals of R, we will work with a dataset from the Aasee in Muenster:
Inform yourself real quick [here](https://opendata.stadt-muenster.de/dataset/aasee-m%C3%BCnster-tagesaktuelle-sensordaten) about the origin of the dataset. You can download it here: [https://github.com/od-ms/aasee-monitoring](https://github.com/od-ms/aasee-monitoring)

Here is an excerpt of the data:


```{r, echo = FALSE}
df <- read.csv(file = "data/2021-06_aasee.csv")
knitr::kable(
  df[1:10,], caption = 'First entries of the Aasee monitoring dataset',
  booktabs = TRUE
)
```


As a first intermediate goal we want to deal with the following task. We will learn all the necessary skills in R and a bit of statistics in the next lessons, but it is valuable to think about the task / question beforehand! 

> Compare the water temperature of 2021 June 02 and July 21.

* What does this task actually mean?
* Reformulate it as a question
* Outline steps to answer the question
