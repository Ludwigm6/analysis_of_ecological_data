# D02: The Aasee Dataset 

To learn the basics about data types, data handling and the fundamentals of R, we will work with a dataset from the Aasee in Muenster:
Inform yourself real quick [here](https://opendata.stadt-muenster.de/dataset/aasee-m%C3%BCnster-tagesaktuelle-sensordaten) about the origin of the dataset. You can download it here: [https://github.com/od-ms/aasee-monitoring](https://github.com/od-ms/aasee-monitoring)

Here is an excerpt of the data:


```{r, echo = FALSE}
df <- read.csv(file = "data/2021-06_aasee.csv")
knitr::kable(
  df[1:10,], caption = 'First entries of the Aasee monitoring dataset',
  booktabs = TRUE
)
```


## Case Study Level 1: Basic Comparisons

As a first intermediate goal we want to deal with the following task. We will learn all the necessary skills in R and a bit of statistics in the next lessons, but it is valuable to think about the task / question beforehand! 

> Compare the water temperature of 2022 April and 2022 May.

* What does this task actually mean? What possibilities do we have?
* Outline steps to answer the question



## Case Study Level 2: Aasee Critical Oxygen Concentrations

In 2018, more than twenty tons of fish died in the Aasee due to low oxygen concentrations: [https://www.uni-muenster.de/news/view.php?cmdid=9768](https://www.uni-muenster.de/news/view.php?cmdid=9768).

Based on this event, a reasonable question might be:

> On how many days of 2022 does the Aasee reach critical oxygen concentrations (4 mg/l)?

* Define the necessary steps!
* Work in your project environment!
* How could a good visualization of this look like?



## Case Study Level 3: Temperature and Oxygen

The oxygen concentration in water is partly based on the water temperature. An idealized relation between Oxygen and Temperature might look like this:

We want to find out if this holds true for the Aasee.

> Formulate a hypothesis.

* Aggregate temperature and oxygen to daily means.
* Visualize the relation between temperature and oxygen in the Aasee.
* Interpret this visualization!
