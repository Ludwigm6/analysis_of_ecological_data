# What is R?

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_url("B01_intro_R_slides.html")
```



## TASK: R and Rstudio

1. Open Rstudio and get familiar with the interface.
2. Create a new, empty R script.
3. What is the difference between the script editor and the console?
4. Copy the code below into the R script and run it line by line. Try to understand what each line does.


```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
a <- 5
b <- 10

a + b

p <- a-b

v <- c(3,12,6,9,23)
v

v / b

mean(v)
# sum(v)
```


## Questions:

* Why does `p <- a-b` not produce an output?
* What is `c()`?
* Why does `# sum(v)` not work?
