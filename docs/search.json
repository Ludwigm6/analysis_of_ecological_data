There are numerous packages that attempt to make it easier, however, each one works a bit different. At the core, colors can be either defined by their name or by their RGB “value”:\nYou can get the name of the 657 predefined colors by calling the colors() function.\n\ncolors()\n\nHere is a little function that shows a random color.\n\ncolorsample = function(){\n    random_color = sample(colors(), 1)\n\nggplot()+\n    labs(title = random_color)+\n    theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = random_color))\n}\n\ncolorsample()\n\nThe second option for colors is using the additive color model.

The syntax of for-loops is quite simple. In the following scheme, statement 1 will be executed once before the loop. Then the green loop block starts. statement 2 is executed multiple times in this case 10 times, once for each run through of the loop. After this, statement 3 is executed once again, as it is outside the loop block.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTranslated into R code, this would look something like this:\n\nprint(\"This text is printed once before the loop.\") # statement  1\n\nfor(i in 1:10){\n    print(\"statement 2\") # statement 2\n}\n\nprint(\"This text is printed once after the loop.\") # statement 3\n\n[1] \"This text is printed once before the loop.\"\n[1] \"statement 2\"\n[1] \"statement 2\"\n[1] \"statement 2\"\n[1] \"statement 2\"\n[1] \"statement 2\"\n[1] \"statement 2\"\n[1] \"statement 2\"\n[1] \"statement 2\"\n[1] \"statement 2\"\n[1] \"statement 2\"\n[1] \"This text is printed once after the loop.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIntuitively, when we write a for-loop, we want to define, how many time the loop should run through the code. However, this is not the right approach to think about loops. Instead, we define a so called iterator, in the example above the variable i. In each run through of the loop, i takes on a different value, here the numbers 1 to 10. The loop stops, once i reached the last defined value.\nSee in the example below, we define a vector with 4 elements and use it in the for() function for the different states of iterator (here called xx). Hence, the loop goes through the print statement 4 times.\n\nnumbers &lt;- c(4, 3, 1, 10)\n\nfor(xx in numbers){\n    print(\"Hi\")\n}\n\n[1] \"Hi\"\n[1] \"Hi\"\n[1] \"Hi\"\n[1] \"Hi\"\n\n\nLoops unlock their full potential once you understand that you can use the iterator (here again xx) inside the loop’s statements. On each run of the loop, you do the same steps, but with slightly different input:\n\nnumbers &lt;- c(4, 25, 1, 49)\n\nfor(xx in numbers){\n  print(paste0(\"The iterator xx is now \", xx, \" and it's square root is:\"))\n  print(sqrt(xx))\n}\n\n[1] \"The iterator xx is now 4 and it's square root is:\"\n[1] 2\n[1] \"The iterator xx is now 25 and it's square root is:\"\n[1] 5\n[1] \"The iterator xx is now 1 and it's square root is:\"\n[1] 1\n[1] \"The iterator xx is now 49 and it's square root is:\"\n[1] 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx &lt;- 1:10\nfor(i in x){\n  result &lt;- i^2\n}\n\nresult\n\n[1] 100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nresult\n\n\n\nWhy is the result 100? What did you expect?\n\n\n\nIf you want to save the result of the loop, you have to assign the output to e.g. element of a vector.\n\nx &lt;- 1:10\nresult &lt;- c()\n\nfor(i in x){\n  result[i] &lt;- x[i]^2\n}\n\nresult\n\n [1]   1   4   9  16  25  36  49  64  81 100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\n\nCreate a vector with 10 random numbers.\nCreate a loop that does the following:\n\nmultiply the number with 2 and print the result\ndivide the number by 3 and save the result",

    "text": "Most data you collect yourself or can download from data repositories will come in some variation or form of a “Excel” style spreadsheet. What I mean by that is, that a row in the table contains different features of the same observation. Each column on the other hand contains the same feature of many different observations. Of course, what information we store with feature and observation heavily depends on the content and purpose of the data.\nTake a look at the following data from the German weather service DWD about sunshine duration across German states. You can get this data here. I will only use a subset of the data:\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nsunshine = sunshine |&gt;\n    filter(Jahr &gt; 2015 & Jahr &lt;= 2020) |&gt;\n    select(\"Jahr\", \"Sachsen\", \"Hessen\", \"Bayern\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJahr\nSachsen\nHessen\nBayern\n\n\n\n\n2016\n649.2\n579.4\n638.5\n\n\n2017\n682.9\n608.2\n720.3\n\n\n2018\n772.1\n774.0\n779.6\n\n\n2019\n791.2\n769.3\n787.0\n\n\n2020\n653.0\n640.2\n695.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake a conscious look on this data.frame for a moment.\n\nWhat information does one row contain?\nWhat is stored in one column?\nWhat is the meaning of the numbers in the data.frame? (And maybe more importantly: How do you know?)\n\n\nThis typical format is called wide as we have information (i.e. the sunshine duration) stored in different columns for different states per observation year (the row). While this is a perfectly fine form of data storage (e.g. you can get a good overview of the data), there is a second organisation scheme that can also be very useful, especially in the context of data analysis and visualization with R: the long format.\n\n\n\nThe principle of the long format is, that we have one column where we store the actual measurement values (sunshine duration in this example). Along that, we have multiple columns with metadata that describe and “encode” each value.

    "text": "Data in Files\nOnce you deal with actual data you want to analyse, it is rare that you want to build a data.frame from scratch in your R script or use a predefined example data from within R. Instead, you have some file prepared on your computer e.g. a .csv file you want to get into R. Most likely, this data comes from a spreadsheet application like Excel or Google Sheets that have their own file formats, e.g. a .xlsx file. While it is possible to import .xlsx files into R with external packages, the more elegant way is to use a much simpler file format: comma separated values - .csv.\nAs the name suggests, a .csv file contains values separated by commas ,:\nplotID, soil_ph, soil_temperature, forest_type\n1, 5.5, 10, coniferous\n2, 5.4, 11, coniferous\n3, 6.1, 12, deciduous\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution with csv files\n\n\n\nIn Germany, , is used as the decimal point. You will often find csv files where the delimiter is a semicolon ;. Sometimes you will also find files where the separator is a tabstop or four spaces.\n\n\nTo get a .csv file into R, use the read.csv() function. Here you can also specify the dec and sep arguments to the correct symbols for decimal points and separators.\n\nsoil = read.csv(\"data/soil_samples.csv\", sep = \",\", dec = \".\")"

Rarely, you need the whole dataframe at once for something. Usually, you only need certain columns, e.g. in order to calculate the average soil temperature for all the locations you would only need the values of the soil_temperature column (mean(df$soil_temperature)). Let’s have a more detailed look at the following question:\n\nWhat is the highest soil pH we measured in coniferous forests?\n\nOf course, just by looking at our little example data.frame, the answer should be 5.5 - But how do we get there with R code? To do this, we have to go step by step and reduce the data.frame logically. If we want to get the maximum soil pH of coniferous forest, we first have to get all the pH values we gathered in coniferous forests. In general, there are only two options when reducing a data.frame:\n\nsubsetting columns, i.e. reducing the data.frame in width\nsubsetting rows i.e. reducing the data.frame in length\n\nThink about which columns you need and how to get to specific rows in this column. Your mental image could look something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: data.frames subsetting with rows and columns\n\n\n\n\n\nWe want to end up with the two cells marked in blue. The column we need to reduce the data.frame to is of course the soil_ph column which we can access easily with the $ operator, however, to get the two specific rows is a bit more tricky. Luckily, with the data.frame, we have more information available that we can use. Combined with the use of logical operators we could reduce the data.frame to the rows where in the forest_type column, the word “coniferous” appears.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: data.frames subsetting with logical operators\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf$soil_ph\n\n[1] 5.5 5.4 6.1\n\ndf$forest_type == 'coniferous'\n\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE\n\nmax(df[df$forest_type == 'coniferous',]$soil_ph)\n\n[1] 5.5",

Usually, these studies follow a plot based design to compare different environments and ecosystems in terms of abundances or species diversity. To practice everything we’ve learned so far we want to have a look at another real world dataset. The species data below was collected by Michael Meyer. To find out more about the original goal of why this data was collected you can have a look at Meyer et al. (2019).

    "text": "Before we do anything in R, let’s first establish three terms that will pop up again and again: Values, Variables and Functions.\nA value is the actual data, like the amount of bats in an area, the forest type or a measurement of soil pH. In R, a value belongs to a data type that depends on what the value should represent:\n\nnumeric represents numbers\ncharacter represents text\nlogical represents whether something is TRUE or FALSE\n\n\n# numeric\n1\n68542\n4.5\n\n# character\n\"f\"\n\"Hi Mom!\"\n\n# logical\nTRUE\nFALSE\n\nA variable in R is a name that represents out data. Think of it as a container in which you can store a value. You can assign values to variables either with &lt;- or =. The name of the variable in on the left, the assigned value on the right. How you name the variable is up to you. However I recommend you use recognizable names! Don’t be lazy - Longer, descriptive names help immensely when you read your code again later and you want to know what a certain variable actually contains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Assign a value to a variable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n23 # just the value\n\nnumber &lt;- 23 # store the value in a variable\n\nStored values in variables are not persistent. You can modify them or even overwrite them - even with values of a different type. So be careful when choosing the names of variables that you have not already used them in the script.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Overwrite the assigned value of a variable\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnumber = \"odonata\"\n\nFunctions are methods that do something with values or values that are stored in variables. Think of them as a machine, where you put in you value and get some result out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Functions are like little machines\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnumber = 23\ncos(number)\n\n[1] -0.532833\n\n\nFunctions are identified by their specific keyword, e.g. the method that calculates the cosine of a certain number is called cos. The function name is followed by parenthesis () making it cos(). In the parenthesis, you define the so called arguments of the function. This can be the input value, options or parameters to specify what the function should. Which arguments a functions requires is written on the help page of the function. You can access the help page with ?cos() or by searching for the function in the ‘Help’ tab in Rstudio (bottom right panel).\n\n# the cos function needs the argument x of type numeric\ncos(x = 0)\n\n[1] 1\n\n# it throws an error otherwise\ncos(x = \"3.14\")\n\nError in cos(x = \"3.14\"): non-numeric argument to mathematical function\n\n# argument names can be neglected\ncos(1)\n\n[1] 0.5403023\n\n\n\n\n\nresult &lt;- cos(23)\n\nWith values, variables and function, you now know the basic building block of R code. So a line like this you can verbalize as “Put the value 23 in the cosine function and store the result in a variable that is called result”. Here is a visual representation of this line of code:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Values, Variables, Functions in one go",

    "text": "Logical Operators are essential to efficiently work with R. It is a good idea to spent some time with them and think about their possibilities and usage.\nBut first: What are logical operators? They are used to compare two values. The most intuitive ones are the &lt; and &gt; operators, for less than and larger than respectively.\n\n4 &lt; 5\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n6 &gt; 2\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nAs you see, both statements return the value TRUE because, — well — 4 is smaller than 5 and 6 is larger than 2. You can think of these operators as functions that takes two inputs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The logical operator is a function with two arguments.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you might guess, if there is TRUE there should also be a FALSE:\n\n24 &gt; 50\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nLogical operators will always return TRUE or FALSE, so the statements you make with them are always questions which you can answer as TRUE or FALSE. As a data type, this is called a logical (or sometimes boolean after the British mathematician George Boole).\n\nbool &lt;- 24 &lt; 50\nclass(bool)\n\n[1] \"logical\"\n\n\n\n\nHere is a list of the most common logical operators. Again, all of these ask different questions about the relationship between two inputs.

To create a linear model, we need two vectors (here as two columns of a data.frame) with the matching data pairs (Abundance and Species Number). The lm function then takes a formula with the vector/column names separated by ~. You can interpret the ~ in this case as a function of. So lm(Species ~ Abundance) means: Give me the number of species as a function of species abundance.\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nbd = read.csv(\"data/crop_species.csv\")\n\nbd = bd %&gt;% mutate(Abundance = AraInd + CaraInd + IsoMyrInd,\n              Species = AraSpec, CaraSpec, IsoMyrSpec)\n\nlmod = lm(Species ~ Abundance, bd)\nlmod\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Species ~ Abundance, data = bd)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)    Abundance  \n   10.71651      0.01749  \n\n\n\n\nCalling the model returns the intercept and slope.

Here we use the same mapping for both sets of points, so we can define the mapping only once in the main ggplot function. If your variables are not the same in both datasets, you also need to redefine the mapping in the geom_ function.\n\nggplot(mapping = aes(x = Jahr, y = Deutschland))+\n    geom_point(data = dwd_spring, color = \"skyblue\")+\n    geom_point(data = dwd_summer, color = \"firebrick\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacets divide the data you want to plot along a specific variable. E.g when we combine the spring and summer temperature from our DWD data, we can create a facet along the Jahreszeiten column to produce the same plot for spring and summer accordingly:\n\ndwd = rbind(dwd_spring, dwd_summer)\n\n\nggplot(dwd, aes(x = Jahr, y = Brandenburg))+\n    geom_line()+\n    geom_point()+\n    facet_wrap(facets = \"Jahreszeit\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, facet_wrap also has many options to alter the plot to ones desire. Again, have a look at the help page - it is very helpful. Try to figure out for yourself what kind of effects the arguments in the following facet_wrap make on the plot.\n\nggplot(dwd, aes(x = Jahr, y = Brandenburg))+\n    geom_line()+\n    geom_point()+\n    facet_wrap(facets = \"Jahreszeit\",\n               ncol = 1,\n               scales = \"free\",\n               strip.position = \"right\")+\n    theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBesides facet_warp, there is facet_grid with slightly different argument options. Here you can define cols and rows as your facet variables.\n\ndwd_long = tidyr::pivot_longer(data = dwd, cols = !all_of(c(\"Jahr\", \"Jahreszeit\")),\n                               names_to = \"Bundesland\",\n                               values_to = \"Temperatur\")\n\ndwd_long = dwd_long |&gt; filter(Bundesland %in% c(\"Bayern\", \"Baden.Wuerttemberg\", \"Rheinland.Pfalz\", \"Hessen\", \"Sachsen\"))\n\n\n\nggplot(dwd_long, aes(x = Jahr, y = Temperatur))+\n    geom_line()+\n    geom_point()+\n    facet_grid(rows = vars(Bundesland),\n               cols = vars(Jahreszeit))+\n    theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery time you create a plot, R needs to know where to draw something. This is called the device - you canvas, so to say. In RStudio, your device is by default automatically set to RStudioGD which refers to the plot window in RStudio. You can check you current device with\n\ndev.cur()\n\nYou can find a list of devices in the help page ?Devices. With the functions you find there you can switch to a different graphic device. For example, use pdf() and your plots will be drawn into a pdf file instead of the RStudio plot window. Once you finished plotting, use dev.off() to turn the device off.\n\npdf(filename = \"nice_plot.pdf\")\n\nggplot(dwd_summer, aes(x = Jahr, y = Deutschland))+\n    geom_line()\n\ndev.off()\n\nPersonally, I often use vector graphics with the svg() device. The plots from R, even with ggplot2 often need some minor tweaks like making the legend a little bit bigger that are too finicky for me to do with code. Instead, I use inkscape for some cosmetic changes in the svg graphic and export it there as a pdf or png. Make sure, however, that you do not alter the actual information that is communicated in the plot!",

Here we use the same mapping for both sets of points, so we can define the mapping only once in the main ggplot function. If your variables are not the same in both datasets, you also need to redefine the mapping in the geom_ function.\n\nggplot(mapping = aes(x = Jahr, y = Deutschland))+\n    geom_point(data = dwd_spring, color = \"skyblue\")+\n    geom_point(data = dwd_summer, color = \"firebrick\")",

E.g when we combine the spring and summer temperature from our DWD data, we can create a facet along the Jahreszeiten column to produce the same plot for spring and summer accordingly:\n\ndwd = rbind(dwd_spring, dwd_summer)\n\n\nggplot(dwd, aes(x = Jahr, y = Brandenburg))+\n    geom_line()+\n    geom_point()+\n    facet_wrap(facets = \"Jahreszeit\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, facet_wrap also has many options to alter the plot to ones desire. Again, have a look at the help page - it is very helpful. Try to figure out for yourself what kind of effects the arguments in the following facet_wrap make on the plot.\n\nggplot(dwd, aes(x = Jahr, y = Brandenburg))+\n    geom_line()+\n    geom_point()+\n    facet_wrap(facets = \"Jahreszeit\",\n               ncol = 1,\n               scales = \"free\",\n               strip.position = \"right\")+\n    theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBesides facet_warp, there is facet_grid with slightly different argument options. Here you can define cols and rows as your facet variables.\n\ndwd_long = tidyr::pivot_longer(data = dwd, cols = !all_of(c(\"Jahr\", \"Jahreszeit\")),\n                               names_to = \"Bundesland\",\n                               values_to = \"Temperatur\")\n\ndwd_long = dwd_long |&gt; filter(Bundesland %in% c(\"Bayern\", \"Baden.Wuerttemberg\", \"Rheinland.Pfalz\", \"Hessen\", \"Sachsen\"))\n\n\n\nggplot(dwd_long, aes(x = Jahr, y = Temperatur))+\n    geom_line()+\n    geom_point()+\n    facet_grid(rows = vars(Bundesland),\n               cols = vars(Jahreszeit))+\n    theme_bw()",

    "text": "Every time you create a plot, R needs to know where to draw something. This is called the device - you canvas, so to say. In RStudio, your device is by default automatically set to RStudioGD which refers to the plot window in RStudio. You can check you current device with\n\ndev.cur()\n\nYou can find a list of devices in the help page ?Devices. With the functions you find there you can switch to a different graphic device. For example, use pdf() and your plots will be drawn into a pdf file instead of the RStudio plot window. Once you finished plotting, use dev.off() to turn the device off.\n\npdf(filename = \"nice_plot.pdf\")\n\nggplot(dwd_summer, aes(x = Jahr, y = Deutschland))+\n    geom_line()\n\ndev.off()\n\nPersonally, I often use vector graphics with the svg() device. The plots from R, even with ggplot2 often need some minor tweaks like making the legend a little bit bigger that are too finicky for me to do with code. Instead, I use inkscape for some cosmetic changes in the svg graphic and export it there as a pdf or png. Make sure, however, that you do not alter the actual information that is communicated in the plot!",
