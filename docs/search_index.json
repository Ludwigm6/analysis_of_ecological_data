Primarily ecologists but the methods and skills are useful in many fields. No R knowledge is required (or other programming skills) It is helpful if you know what a spreadsheet is Minimum amount of statistic needed (course explains all the necessary stuff) 1.2 Aims of this course Developing ideas, answering questions Defining steps how to solve a problem Translating these steps into R code Learning the R language “on the fly” Data handling. A lot of data handling. I believe a good understanding of data is one of the most important things in science and work. Learn statistics. Use statistics as a tool. developing good scripting and project management habits from the start (makes live so much easier) 1.3 What this course is not statistics as in mathematical equations \\[ \\left( {\\begin{array}{*{20}c} n \\\\ k \\\\ \\end{array}} \\right) = \\frac{{n!}}{{k!\\left( {n - k} \\right)!}} \\] \\[ \\sigma ^2 = \\mu _2 = \\sum {\\left( {x - \\mu _1 } \\right)^2 P\\left( x \\right)} \\] R as in computer science You probably won’t find out anything you didn’t already know about nature 1.4 Course Outline 2022 Table 1.1: Course Outline Date Content 07.04.

Try out the following functions: length(), range(), seq() Come up with a reasonable questions that someone might have looking at this data. 5.5 Subsetting For many questions it is often required to access only parts of the data. This is one of the most common things you have to deal with in R. 5.5.1 Indexing To access single values of a vector, use square brackets []. # get the third value of the vector temperature[3] ## [1] 18.92 # accessing multiple elements at once temperature[1,2] ## Error in temperature[1, 2]: incorrect number of dimensions temperature[c(1,2)] ## [1] 18.81 18.73 Using the functions above, what is an easy way to access the first 10 elements of the vector? 5.5.2 Logical Operators Figure 5.4: R vector logical operation A more powerful way to subset a vector is by using logical operators.
