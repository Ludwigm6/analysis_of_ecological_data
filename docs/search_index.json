Primarily ecologists but of course the methods are used in all fields. No R knowledge is required (or other programming skills) It is helpful if you know what a spreadsheet is Minimum amount of statistic (course explains all the necessary stuff) 1.2 Aims of this course Developing ideas, answering questions Defining steps how to solve a problem Translating these steps into R code Learning the R language “on the fly” Data handling. A lot of data handling. I belive a good understanding of data is one of the most important things in modern science and work. Learn statistics. Use statistics as a tool. developing good scripting and project management habits from the start (makes live so much easier) 1.3 What this course is not statistics as in mathematics R as in computer science You probably won’t find out anything you didn’t already know about nature Table 1.1: Course Outline Date Content 07.04.
