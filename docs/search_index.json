Primarily ecologists but the methods and skills are useful in many fields. No R knowledge is required (or other programming skills) It is helpful if you know what a spreadsheet is Minimum amount of statistic needed (course explains all the necessary stuff) 1.2 Aims of this course Developing ideas, answering questions Defining steps how to solve a problem Translating these steps into R code Learning the R language “on the fly” Data handling. A lot of data handling. I believe a good understanding of data is one of the most important things in science and work. Learn statistics. Use statistics as a tool. developing good scripting and project management habits from the start (makes live so much easier) 1.3 What this course is not statistics as in mathematical equations \\[ \\left( {\\begin{array}{*{20}c} n \\\\ k \\\\ \\end{array}} \\right) = \\frac{{n!}}{{k!\\left( {n - k} \\right)!}} \\] \\[ \\sigma ^2 = \\mu _2 = \\sum {\\left( {x - \\mu _1 } \\right)^2 P\\left( x \\right)} \\] R as in computer science You probably won’t find out anything you didn’t already know about nature 1.4 Course Outline 2022 Table 1.1: Course Outline Date Content 07.04.

If we want a different month or day we have to make changes in the code. As an R beginner, this is not something you should worry about to much - better spend your time to figure out what the R functions do and get the job done. Later on in your R journey this is something you should keep in mind and write more generalized code by writing your own R functions.

This is often harder than the actual R code itself. To keep everything easy and consistent within R (at least for this course), I recommend using Rstudio Projects with a standardized directory setup. 7.1 R studio Projects Here is an example from a blog entry at r-bloggers.com A good starting point for project setup Inside a project, you can then use relative paths to files. # Example of absolute path ## Linux &quot;/home/marvin/projects/rcourse/session02/data/file.csv&quot; ## Windows &quot;C:\\Users\\Marvin\\Dokumente\\rcourse\\session02\\data\\file.csv&quot; # If the R project is set up in the &quot;session02&quot; directory we can use relative paths: # relative path to project root data = read.csv(&quot;data/file.csv&quot;) Additional thoughts always keep raw data backups! filepaths: no spaces no dots no weird characters How to name files Windows uses backslash \\, R wants forward slash / you can use the dir.create function to create a new empty directory "],["string-handling.html", "8 String handling 8.1 The stringr package 8.2 Leading Zeros", " 8 String handling Modifying strings (i.e. text) is a very common task but can be a bit tricky if you start out. Here are some functions to try out: create strings from multiple “substrings” with the paste or paste0 function n = 5 paste(&quot;The number five:&quot;, n) ## [1] &quot;The number five: 5&quot; # again functions are vectorized paste(seq(10), &quot;is&quot;, c(&quot;odd&quot;, &quot;even&quot;)) ## [1] &quot;1 is odd&quot; &quot;2 is even&quot; &quot;3 is odd&quot; &quot;4 is even&quot; &quot;5 is odd&quot; ## [6] &quot;6 is even&quot; &quot;7 is odd&quot; &quot;8 is even&quot; &quot;9 is odd&quot; &quot;10 is even&quot; # paste0 defaults to no character for separating the strings paste0(n, &quot;five&quot;, n) ## [1] &quot;5five5&quot; 8.1 The stringr package For advanced string handling we will make our lives easier by using the stringr package. To use functions from a package we have to load it first with the library function. The first time you want to use a package you might have to install it first with install.packages. install.packages(&quot;stringr&quot;) library(stringr) Many packages have so called vignettes which are tutorial style help pages about the package. You can access vignettes via the “Packages” Pane in R studio or with a quick Google search. It is a good idea to go over the vignette when using a new package. s = &quot;Hi Mom!&quot; # you can indicate in your script from which package a function comes from # by using :: stringr::str_length(s) ## [1] 7 str_sub(string = s, start = 1, end = 2) ## [1] &quot;Hi&quot; string_vector = paste(seq(10), &quot;is&quot;, c(&quot;odd&quot;, &quot;even&quot;)) string_vector ## [1] &quot;1 is odd&quot; &quot;2 is even&quot; &quot;3 is odd&quot; &quot;4 is even&quot; &quot;5 is odd&quot; ## [6] &quot;6 is even&quot; &quot;7 is odd&quot; &quot;8 is even&quot; &quot;9 is odd&quot; &quot;10 is even&quot; str_remove(string_vector, pattern = &quot;is &quot;) ## [1] &quot;1 odd&quot; &quot;2 even&quot; &quot;3 odd&quot; &quot;4 even&quot; &quot;5 odd&quot; &quot;6 even&quot; &quot;7 odd&quot; ## [8] &quot;8 even&quot; &quot;9 odd&quot; &quot;10 even&quot; str_replace(string_vector, pattern = &quot; is&quot;, replacement = &quot;:&quot;) ## [1] &quot;1: odd&quot; &quot;2: even&quot; &quot;3: odd&quot; &quot;4: even&quot; &quot;5: odd&quot; &quot;6: even&quot; ## [7] &quot;7: odd&quot; &quot;8: even&quot; &quot;9: odd&quot; &quot;10: even&quot; 8.2 Leading Zeros str_pad one can be quite important to keep you sane. string_vector = paste(seq(15), &quot;is&quot;, c(&quot;odd&quot;, &quot;even&quot;)) string_vector ## [1] &quot;1 is odd&quot; &quot;2 is even&quot; &quot;3 is odd&quot; &quot;4 is even&quot; &quot;5 is odd&quot; ## [6] &quot;6 is even&quot; &quot;7 is odd&quot; &quot;8 is even&quot; &quot;9 is odd&quot; &quot;10 is even&quot; ## [11] &quot;11 is odd&quot; &quot;12 is even&quot; &quot;13 is odd&quot; &quot;14 is even&quot; &quot;15 is odd&quot; string_vector_pad = paste(str_pad(seq(15), width = 2, pad = 0, side = &quot;left&quot;), &quot;is&quot;, c(&quot;odd&quot;, &quot;even&quot;)) string_vector_pad ## [1] &quot;01 is odd&quot; &quot;02 is even&quot; &quot;03 is odd&quot; &quot;04 is even&quot; &quot;05 is odd&quot; ## [6] &quot;06 is even&quot; &quot;07 is odd&quot; &quot;08 is even&quot; &quot;09 is odd&quot; &quot;10 is even&quot; ## [11] &quot;11 is odd&quot; &quot;12 is even&quot; &quot;13 is odd&quot; &quot;14 is even&quot; &quot;15 is odd&quot; "],["casestudy-aasee-fish-mortality.html", "9 Casestudy: Aasee fish mortality 9.1 TASK: Aasee Critical Oxygen Concentrations 9.2 TASK: Oxygen vs. Temperature", " 9 Casestudy: Aasee fish mortality In 2018, more than twenty tons of fish died in the Aasee due to low oxygen concentrations: https://www.uni-muenster.de/news/view.php?cmdid=9768.
