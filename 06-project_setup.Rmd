# Project Setup

Once you deal with external files (e.g. loading a .csv), saving outputs or reports, you have to deal with a senseful file structure.
This is often harder than the actual R code itself. To keep everything easy and consistent within R (at least for this course), I recommend using Rstudio Projects with a standardized directory setup.


## R studio Projects

Here is an example from a blog entry at [r-bloggers.com](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2020/01/rstudio-projects-and-working-directories-a-beginners-guide/)

![A good starting point for project setup](https://i1.wp.com/raw.githubusercontent.com/martinctc/blog/master/images/RPROJECT_2000dpi.png?w=578&ssl=1)

Inside a project, you can then use relative paths to files.



```{r, eval = FALSE}

# Example of absolute path

## Linux
"/home/marvin/projects/rcourse/session02/data/file.csv"

## Windows
"C:\Users\Marvin\Dokumente\rcourse\session02\data\file.csv"

# If the R project is set up in the "session02" directory we can use relative paths:

# relative path to project root
data = read.csv("data/file.csv")



```



**Additional thoughts**

* always keep raw data
* **backups!**
* filepaths:
    * no spaces
    * no dots
    * no weird characters
* Windows uses backslash `\`, R wants forward slash `/`
* you can use the `dir.create` function to create a new empty directory
