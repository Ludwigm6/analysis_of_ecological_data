# Casestudy: Aasee fish mortality


In 2018, more than twenty tons of fish died in the Aasee due to low oxygen concentrations: [https://www.uni-muenster.de/news/view.php?cmdid=9768](https://www.uni-muenster.de/news/view.php?cmdid=9768).

Based on this event, a reasonable question might be:

> On how many days does the Aasee reach critical oxygen concentrations (4 mg/l)?


## TASK: Aasee Critical Oxygen Concentrations

* On how many days of July 2021 did the Aasee reach critical oxygen concentrations (4 mg/l)?
* Define the necessary steps!
* Work in your project environment!
* How could a good visualization of this look like?



## TASK: Oxygen vs. Temperature

The oxygen concentration in water is partly based on the water temperature. An idealized relation between Oxygen and Temperature might look like this:

We want to find out if this holds true for the Aasee.

> Formulate a hypothesis.

* Aggregate temperature and oxygen to daily means.
* Visualize the relation between temperature and oxygen in the Aasee.
* Interpret this visualization!
