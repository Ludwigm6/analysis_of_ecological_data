* R is a script Language
* Version 1.0 from 2000 (concept dates back to 1974)
* Original Aim: Statistical Analysis
* Designed for data analysis and "interactive" use

## R Code

How R code looks like:

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
data <- c(12, 45, 65, 1, 3, 87)
mean(data)

data <- data + 5
sort(data)
```


How R code looks like with output:

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
data <- c(12, 45, 65, 1, 3, 87)
mean(data)

data <- data + 5
sort(data)
```



## Why R?

* Easy to get into (although it might not feel that way at first)
* Designed for solving scientific problems
* Big community - Getting help is really easy.
* Open-source, active development


> The R package structure has been the key addition to the software - @Chambers2020


* Expandable with `packages` provided by other R users
    * Specialized analysis for specific fields
    * Machine Learning
    * Medicine
    * Writing Books
    * ...
* Used in science, industry, healthcare, NGOs, ...

## Rstudio

* Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
* Makes R "convenient" to use
* Text Editor + R Console
* Project Environments, Package Management, Help Pages, Plot Viewer, File Browser ...


## TASK: R and Rstudio

1. Open Rstudio and get familiar with the interface.
2. Create a new, empty R script.
3. What is the difference between the script editor and the console?
4. Copy the code below into the R script and run it line by line. Try to understand what each line does.


```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
a <- 5
b <- 10

a + b

p <- a-b

v <- c(3,12,6,9,23)
v

v / b

mean(v)
# sum(v)
```


### Questions you might have

* Why does `p <- a*b` not produce an output?
* What is `c()`?
* Why does `# sum(v)` not work?
