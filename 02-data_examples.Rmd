# Ecological data 

Take a few minutes to think about

* what kind of data you know or have used before?
* what kind of data would be interesting for you?


```{r mofrgb, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Marburg Open Forest, 2019-05-13 Planetscope RGB"}
mof_water = st_read("data/mof/mof_supplementary.gpkg", layer =  "water", quiet = TRUE)
mof_rgb = read_stars("data/mof/mof_basemaps.gpkg", sub = "planetscope_20190513", quiet = TRUE)

tm_shape(mof_rgb)+
    tm_rgb(saturation = 0.4)+
    tm_shape(mof_water)+
    tm_lines(col = "skyblue", lwd = 2.5)+
    tm_layout(frame = FALSE)
```


> Ask yourself how you could describe and quantify a landscape like the one in Fig. \@ref(fig:mofrgb).


## Plot surveys

* plots with ID and surveyed environmental information
* bread and butter of ecology

```{r, echo = FALSE}
df = data.frame(plotID = c("P1", "P2", "P3"),
           soil_ph = c(5.5, 5.4, 6.1),
           soil_temperature = c(10, 11, 12),
           forest_type = c("coniferous", "coniferous", "deciduous"))

knitr::kable(
  df, caption = 'Field survery data on a plot level',
  booktabs = TRUE
)
```


## Time Series

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Visualization of time series data"}
df <- read.csv(file = "data/2021-06_aasee.csv")
colnames(df) = c("date", "temperature", "ph", "o2")
df$date <- as.Date(df$date)

dfmean <- df %>% group_by(date) %>% summarise(temperature = mean(temperature))

ggplot(dfmean, aes(date, temperature))+
    geom_line()+
    theme_light()
```


* continuous measurements
* measurement interval flexible
* mainly climate, soil, remote sensing


```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  df[c(5,10,15,20,25),], caption = 'Time series data: Aasee sensor measurements',
  booktabs = TRUE, row.names = FALSE
)
```


## Species Lists

* mostly plot based
* monitoring of conservation sites
* biodiversity assessment


```{r, echo = FALSE}
df = data.frame(species = c("Digitalis purpurea", "Galium odoratum", "Fagus Sylvatica","..."),
                n = c("4", "25", "20", "..."))
knitr::kable(
  df, caption = 'Species Lists: Occurence on a plot',
  booktabs = TRUE
)
```


> What are the differences between the plot based survey example and the species list example?


## Geospatial Data

* defined by explicit location on the earth surface
* information attached to coordinates

```{r, echo = FALSE}
set.seed(10)
mof_trees = st_read("data/mof/mof_trees.gpkg", quiet = TRUE) %>% 
    na.omit() %>%
    slice_sample(n = 5) %>% 
    select(-socialposition) %>% 
    mutate(dbh = round(dbh, 2))


knitr::kable(
  mof_trees, caption = 'Geospatial Data: Tree locations',
  booktabs = TRUE
)

mapview::mapview(mof_trees, zcol = "dbh")
```
