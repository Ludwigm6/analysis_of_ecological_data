# Load the dataset "cropspecies.csv" into R (Learnweb).

# How many different crop types where analysed in the study?

# How many plots are there for each crop type?

# Which plot had the most individual animals? (regardless of species)

# Which plot had the most species?

# What is the average number of Carabidaes on all the plots containing winter wheat?

# What is the average number of individuals and species per crop type? (Hint: `dplyr::group_by`, `dplyr::summarise`)

# Visualize the number of Carabidaes per crop type.

# Compare the number of species of Araneae, Carabidae and IsopodaMyriapoda with a boxplot. (Hint: `tidyr::pivot_longer`)

# Plot the number of Araneae species in relation to the number of individual Araneae.

# If there are more individual Araneae on a plot, are there also more Araneae species? (Hint: `lm`)
