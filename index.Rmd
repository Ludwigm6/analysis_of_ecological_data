# Welcome {.unnumbered}

```{r, fig.cap = "Landscape Ecology with R", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/cover_image.png")
```


## Target audience

* You want answers to questions (in landscape ecology)!
* Primarily ecologists but the methods and skills are useful in many fields.
* No R knowledge is required (or other programming skills)
* It is helpful if you know what a spreadsheet is
* Minimum amount of statistic needed (course explains all the necessary stuff)


## Aims of this course

* Developing ideas, answering questions
* Defining steps how to solve a problem
* Translating these steps into R code
* Learning the necessary R language on the way
* Data handling. A lot of data handling.
* I believe a good understanding of data is one of the most important things in science and work.
* Learn statistics. Use statistics as a tool.


## What this course is not

* statistics as in mathematical equations

$$
\left( {\begin{array}{*{20}c}
   n  \\
   k  \\
\end{array}} \right) = \frac{{n!}}{{k!\left( {n - k} \right)!}}
$$

$$
\sigma ^2  = \mu _2  = \sum {\left( {x - \mu _1 } \right)^2 P\left( x \right)}
$$

* R as in computer science
* You probably won't find out anything you didn't already know about nature
